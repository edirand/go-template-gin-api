# Go template: Gin Api
This repository contains a template to get started with Gin framework. 

## Features

- A configured Gin server ready to run
- An error handler to convert errors to ProblemDetails
- A Todo handler with sample routes 

## Getting started

You can start a new project with this template using [gonew](https://go.dev/blog/gonew).

```shell
gonew github.com/edirand/go-template-gin-api <destination_module>
```
Once the project ready, you can replace this README by your own. A default readme is provided in the docs folder to help you.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add configuration for the server based on environment or config files
